= Spring Cloud Streams

* Bindings — a collection of Java functions to process, transform, or send messages
* Binder — messaging-middleware implementation such as Kafka or RabbitMQ
* Channel — represents the communication pipe between messaging-middleware and the application
* Message Schemas — used for serialization and deserialization of messages, these schemas can be statically read from a location or loaded dynamically, supporting the evolution of domain object types
* StreamListeners — message-handling methods in beans that will be automatically invoked on a message from the channel after the MessageConverter does the serialization/deserialization between middleware-specific events and domain object types or POJOs
